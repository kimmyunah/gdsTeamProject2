            <h3><span>Disney World, Florida</span></h3>
            <br>
            <p>Disney World is the most magical place on earth. Each park offers a variety
                of different rides, characters, shows, food, and environments, Hollywood Studios being my personal favorite. 
                It is suitable for all ages and is a great place to go to to feel like a child again. From shows, rides, scavenger hunts, 
                food and wine, art, parades, fireworks, light shows, and meeting characters, among other things, there is something 
                enjoyable for everyone. If you are planning on visiting, hit me up and I'll go with you!</p>

            <h3><span>NC Outer Banks</span></h3>
            <br>
            <p>A 100-mile stretch of four barrier islands, the Outer Banks of North Carolina offer an alluring experience of the rhythms
                of nature and sea that flow through the scenic lighthouses, quaint villages, wild horses, windswept beaches, and scruffy
                crab shacks of the coast. Highway 12 connects much of the Outer Banks as well as its 400 years of history as commemorated in 
                places like the Wright Brothers National Memorial and Kitty Hawk and Kill Devil Hills.</p>

            <h3><span>Cliffs of Moher</span></h3>
            <br>
            <p>As soon as I saw a photo of them, it was clear to me that I had to visit them on my next trip to Ireland. One of the most visited natural attractions in all of Ireland, the Cliffs of Moher rise up from the swells of the great Atlantic Ocean. On top, they are covered with the islandâ€™s trademark meadows of verdant green grass, while the waters of Galway Bay crash and froth against the stone below. At 120 meters in height, you can feel the cool breeze combing through your hair.

            <h3><span>Waterwheel, Payson, AZ</span></h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                Waterwheel located in Payson, AZ is a wonderful get away full of scenic views. Not only is it a great place to cool 
                off from the Arizona sun, but it is also a great getaway with the family. The trail includes a lot of hiking and allows you to 
                be one with nature. Being in bear country you will be exposed to all sorts of animals including fish, birds, etc.
