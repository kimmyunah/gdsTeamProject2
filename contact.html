        <h1><strong>Why we started</strong></h1>
        <p>Welcome! We appreciate you stopping by. 
            We want to start by explaining the name of our blog. 
            It took us forever for us to name it and you might be wondering what "Backpack" might mean. 
            Well, here is the short story: On July 9th, 2020, We dicided to leave the US for a trip around the world. 
            The idea was to backpack throughout the globe only ourbackpack for lightweight, convinient, and adventurous travel.

        <h1><strong>Our mission</strong></h1>
        <p>The purpose of our website is simple. We want to use our own experiences to prove that travel does not have to be a crazy fantasy. 
            It can, and should be, a realistic lifestyle option instead.
            That’s the reason why we started this blog and it remains the core mission today.
            Through my our adventures – from the incredible moments and rewarding interactions to the struggles 
            and major challenges – we aim to provide a realistic and honest account of 
            what travel is truly about and how you can work on achieving such a goal yourself.
