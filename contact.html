        <div class="WhyWeStarted">
            <h2><strong>Why we started Backpack</strong></h2>
            <br>
            <p>Welcome! We appreciate you stopping by. We want to start by explaining the name of our blog. 
            It took us forever for us to name it and you might be wondering what "Backpack" might mean. 
            Well, here is the short story: We dicided to leave the US for a trip around the world with one item: our backpack. 
            The idea was to backpack throughout the globe with only ourbackpack for lightweight, convinient, and adventurous travel.

        <div class="Mission">
            <h2><strong>Our mission</strong></h2>
            <br>
            <p>The purpose of our website is simple. We want to use our own experiences to prove that travel does not have to be a crazy fantasy. 
            It can, and should be, a realistic lifestyle option instead.
            That’s the reason why we started this blog and it remains the core mission today.
            Through my our adventures – from the incredible moments and rewarding interactions to the struggles 
            and major challenges – we aim to provide a realistic and honest account of 
            what travel is truly about and how you can work on achieving such a goal yourself. We aim to humanize the places we visit, drawing our readers 
            in through photographs and stories, so they connect with people and places they might otherwise never hear about or actively disregard.

                I’m a software engineer by day but avid hiker by whenever I don’t have to work! Wherever there’s a mountain you’ll definitely see 
                me trying to hike it at 3 in the morning to watch a great sunrise. I’ve climbed about a hundred different mountains but I’ve got my 
                eye set on Everest next!

            <p>Traveling and documenting these travels have been a life-long dream come true. 
            I have been to over 52 countries, and if you ask me where I have been that is my favorite, 
            I will not be able to answer. I love to travel to destinations with a story to tell. The hidden gems, 
            local specialities, and awe-inspiring natural scenery make each and every journey uniquely valuable. 
            And trying different types of food is a major long-term mood booster!

            <p>I quit my job to travel the world with $1,500 USD to my name and that was it. In November of 2014, 
                I booked a one-way ticket to Auckland, New Zealand, and never looked back. 
                By now, I've traveled to 83 countries and all seven continents!
                The world is my oyster and all of the beautiful coulters I have encountered are the pearl. 
                My trips are driven by curiosity and filled with adventure!

            I’ve been traveling around the world since I was 2 years old. 
            I’ve gone to 11 countries all in one day including Morocco, Japan, Germany, Mexico, and Italy, among others. 
            I’ve taken in their culture, people, and delicious food. Granted, by around the world I mean around the EPCOT World Showcase. 
            Every trip has been a magical experience.

            Traveling has always been one of my dreams. Recently I have come to the realization that you only live once and 
            shouldn't worry about materialistic things as those fade away with time. I decided to quit my job and pursue my 
            lifelong dream. I stopped putting things off and decided to take action. I now happily travel the world and get to meet amazing new people!
